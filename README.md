# MLB Contract WAR Calculator (Beta)

**‚ö†Ô∏è BETA VERSION**: This application is in active development. Features may change, and bugs may exist.

A React-based web application that analyzes MLB player contracts and team payrolls from a performance vs. salary perspective.

üîó **Live Beta**: [https://contract-war-calculator.onrender.com/](https://contract-war-calculator.onrender.com/)

## What is this?

Ever wondered if your team overpaid for that free agent? Or found an absolute steal in a trade? This calculator answers those questions by comparing what teams pay versus what they get in return, measured in WAR (Wins Above Replacement).

The tool transforms complex baseball analytics into simple answers: Is this contract good value or not?

## Features

### üßÆ Three Calculator Modes

1. **WAR Value Calculator** - Analyze individual player contracts
   - Choose between fWAR, bWAR, or average
   - Get instant categorization from "Historic Bargain" to "Poor Value"
   - See surplus value in dollars

2. **wRC+ Value Calculator** - Focus on offensive production
   - Convert hitting performance to dollar value
   - Perfect for evaluating DHs and corner positions
   - Position-adjusted comparisons

3. **Team Analysis** - Evaluate entire payrolls
   - See which teams spend efficiently
   - Project full-season wins
   - Compare actual vs. expected performance

### üéØ Additional Features

- **Position Adjustments**: Compare players to their positional peers
- **Example Contracts**: One-click examples from each value category
- **Calculation History**: Track your last 10 calculations
- **Share via URL**: Send specific calculations to friends
- **Mobile Optimized**: Works great on phones and tablets
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities

## How It Works

The calculator uses straightforward formulas based on current market rates:

**For Individual Players:**
- Cost per WAR = Salary √∑ WAR
- Market rate ‚âà $8M per WAR (2024)
- Surplus Value = (WAR √ó $8M) - Salary

**For Teams:**
- Projected Wins = (Team WAR √∑ 43) √ó 81
- A .500 team typically has ~43 WAR

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Hosting**: Render.com
- **PWA**: Service Worker for offline use
