# MLB Contract WAR Calculator

A React-based web application that analyzes MLB player contracts and team payrolls from a performance vs. salary perspective. Calculate $/WAR (dollars per Wins Above Replacement) to determine if contracts represent good value.

ðŸ”— **Live Demo**: [https://contract-war-calculator.onrender.com/](https://contract-war-calculator.onrender.com/)

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Three Calculator Modes

#### 1. Individual WAR Value
- Input player salary and WAR
- Select WAR type (fWAR, bWAR, or average)
- Optional position-adjusted analysis
- Categorizes contracts from "Historic Bargain" to "Poor Value"

#### 2. wRC+ Value
- Convert wRC+ to estimated WAR value
- Calculate surplus value based on offensive performance
- Position-specific comparisons
- Efficiency ratings vs. league average hitters

#### 3. Team Analysis
- Analyze entire team payroll efficiency
- Calculate projected wins based on team WAR
- Compare actual vs. expected performance
- Support for total or active payroll

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- **Position-Adjusted Calculations**: Compare players to their positional averages
- **Example Contracts**: Quick-fill buttons with real player/team examples
- **Calculation History**: Track your recent calculations (stored locally)
- **URL Sharing**: Share calculations via URL parameters
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully optimized for all devices
- **Dark Theme**: Sleek black background with red accents matching BadderSports brand

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Deployment**: Render.com (auto-deploys from main branch)

## How It Works

### Individual Player Calculations
- **Cost per WAR**: `Salary / WAR`
- **Contract Efficiency**: `(WAR Ã— $740K) / Salary`
- **Surplus Value**: `(WAR Ã— $8M) - Salary`

### Team Calculations
- **Cost per WAR**: `Payroll / Team WAR`
- **Expected WAR**: `Payroll / $8M`
- **Efficiency Rating**: `Actual WAR / Expected WAR`
- **Projected Wins**: `(Team WAR / 43) Ã— 81`

### Value Categories
**Individual ($/WAR)**:
- Historic Bargain: < $2M
- High Value: < $6M
- Average: < $10M
- Poor Value: â‰¥ $10M or negative WAR

**Team Efficiency**:
- Elite: < $3M per WAR
- Above Average: < $6M per WAR
- Average: < $10M per WAR
- Below Average: < $15M per WAR
- Inefficient: â‰¥ $15M per WAR
