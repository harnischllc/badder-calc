# Testing & Security
- Unit tests for `src/utils/*` and CSV validators.
- Integration tests for critical routes: CSV upload, calculators, team analyzer.
- Security headers: set HSTS, no sniff, frameguard on backend; sanitize CSV fields.
- Rate-limit admin endpoints; log auth-sensitive events without PII.
- Never commit `.env*`. If the agent sees secret-like strings, stop and ask for env var names.
