## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Testing the New Features**

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - Open your browser to the local development URL
   - You'll see a toggle button to switch between forms

3. **Try the Enhanced Form:**
   - Click "🚀 Switch to Enhanced Form" (default)
   - Search for a player (e.g., "Mike Trout", "Aaron Judge")

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **API Integration**
- **MLB Stats API**: Free, public API for player data
- **Caching**: 5-minute cache for performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

### **Data Flow**
1. User searches for player
2. MLB API returns player list
3. User selects player
4. Player statistics load automatically
5. User manually enters salary/WAR (Phase 2 will auto-populate)
6. Calculator processes data

### **State Management**
- `selectedPlayer`: Currently selected player data
- `useEnhancedForm`: Toggle between old and new forms
- All existing state preserved for compatibility

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Player search functionality
- [ ] Player selection and data loading
- [ ] Statistics display
- [ ] Form toggle between classic/enhanced
- [ ] Calculator functionality with new form

- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### **API Testing**
```bash
# Test MLB API directly
curl "https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people?search=Mike%20Trout&limit=5"
```

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### **Current Status**
- ✅ Phase 1 implementation complete
- ✅ Integration with main app
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- 🔄 Ready for testing and feedback

### **Next Steps**
1. **Testing Phase**: Test with real users
2. **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues found
